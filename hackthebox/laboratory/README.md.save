The address resolution for `http://10.10.10.216:80/` will redirect to `https://laboratory.htb` (Notice the secure HTTP connection and port 443 open (which works for encrypted HTTP traffic)). Add this to `/etc/hosts`.

## Port 80

Redirects to port 443

## Port 443

- Has a single webpage. All links remain on the same webpage. Source of `index.html` points to two pages (commented code) `generic.html` and `element.html` but both are non-existent.

- Has the directory `assets/` visible which seems strange. Normal folders (`/css`, `/js`, and `/fonts`). An interesting subdirectory is the `/sass` subdirectory. Contains `.scss` files which are like CSS but with better formatting.

- Another open directory `images/`

- Another forbidden directory 'server-status/'

## Getting to the virtual host

- There was nothing in the actual site, so there was something I was missing. And it was always before me. The nmap scan revealed `git.laboratory.htb` as the alternative DNS. Adding it to `/etc/hosts` and we arrive to the Gitlab Community Version.

- The certificate to the site is self-signed.

- You might see that any sample email domain is not taken in by the Register page. So I wondered the only domain correct was `@laboratory.htb` and it was right. After all the developers wanted only their people to get on-board.

- The exploit for Ready does not work in here for some reason.

- There is `robots.txt` available which is similar to the file found in Ready.

- Two decent users come up: `https://git.laboratory.htb/dexter` and `https://git.laboratory.htb/seven`.

- dexter has in his repo that old website. Nothing exciting there. But seven has raised an issue against the website:

```
Hi, I cloned this website and when I try to launch my server it gives a HTTP 418 response. How to fix please?
```

Two things come out of this: they cloned it and the response is HTTP 418. HTTP 418 is 'I'm a teapot' thing. This implies the server responds back it can't handle the request, but there may be other servers who can. This isn't very helpful to us in this case.

## Finding an exploit

- To find an exploit, need a version for the GitLab. After signing in, there's a help section which reveals the section `GitLab Community Edition 12.8.1`.

- Arbitrary file read: `https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/cve-2020-10977`

- RCE: `https://github.com/dotPY-hax/gitlab_RCE`

- A report: `https://hackerone.com/reports/827052` (read `vakzz`'s report regarding the RCE using the same thing)
