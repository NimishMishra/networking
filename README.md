## The Code

- Try Harder 

- Progress is not moving forward on the problem. It is learning more. If you are learning ways that don't work, you are progressing and don't qualify to ask/look for hints. 

- Applications break on bad inputs, not on good ones. Developers forget to consider bad inputs or edge test cases, they are your go-to.
